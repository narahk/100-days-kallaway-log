## 100 Days Of Code - Log Round 1

### Day 1: October 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Half way throught FCC JavaScript Basic - Understanding Boolean/Comparison.

**Thoughts:** I thought this would be easy, but bit challenging though.

**Link to work:** [Comparisons with the Logical Or Operator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/comparisons-with-the-logical-or-operator)
### Day 2: October 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Never used Github before so I had a hard time finding my way around. Learned basic grid layout, feature queries and continued with freecodecamp tutorials. I'm on JavaScript Objects.

**Thoughts:** I find HTML and CSS easy. I can't get my head around JavaScript. I need to read and understand the basics.

### Day 3-5: October 14-16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I was not able to connect to Github for Day 3-4, but I've tweeted my days. Day 3 - I did a bit of reading on feature queries and continued FreeCodeCamp tutorials. Day 4 - I fried my brains working on JS Object & Property with FreeCodeCamp tutorials. Day 5 - I did a bit of reading to understand JS function & do some JS challenge on Edabit to brush up on my skills.

**Thoughts:** I need to start with the basic and fully understand them before I can move on to more advance stuff. I need to read and practice more.

### Day 6: October 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Halfway through FreeCodeCamp tutorial - JS Object Oriented & Functional Programming. I'm starting to understand function declaration and expression.

**Thoughts:** Need to continue practicing and read more about the tutorials.

### Day 7: October 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed JS Object Oriented & Functional Programming. Onto Basic Algorithm Scripting. Got to think like a programmer. 

**Thoughts:** I'm still can't get my head around JavaScript. I mean how do I know when to use loops, functions etc. I need to research more and practice as well.

**Link to work:** Don't have any work to link to yet. I'm still doing tutorials. I'd like to build a personal webpage so that I can write about my coding journey.
