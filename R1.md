### Day 1: October 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Half way throught FCC JavaScript Basic - Understanding Boolean/Comparison.

### Day 2: October 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Never used Github before so I had a hard time finding my way around. Learned basic grid layout, feature queries and continued with freecodecamp tutorials. I'm on JavaScript Objects.
